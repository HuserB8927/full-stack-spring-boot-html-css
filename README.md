# Full stack project 
- which uses html-css in the frontend and Spring Boot in the backend. This project is my reference.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HuserB8927/full-stack-spring-boot-html-css.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HuserB8927/full-stack-spring-boot-html-css)

The app is available on www.benjaminhalasz.com <br>

You can just Create a New Account clicking on www.benjaminhalasz.com/login but there is no login set up ny default. After you create a new account the program would normally send you a confirmation email to activate your registration. (I left the gmail username/password blank in the application.properties so you wont get an email now.)<br>

After you logged in you can see my resume, my IT and programming skills, my videos and everythig that connects to these topics.

Every suggestion and feedback would be gratly appreciated. 

Thank you for visiting.
